If necessary, \"occupation settlements\" should be dismantled or given to Palestinians.* Israel and Palestine must allow Jerusalem to be split or shared.* Palestine must give up the \"right of return,\" which would be suicide for Israel.* Israel must give up the extreme Zionist dream of an Israel drawn up according to biblical borders.* Israel must give up the dream of sole ownership of all of Jerusalem.* Agreement to any of these principles should not be a precondition for negotiations.  However, Israel should cease development of occupation settlements, and Palestine should do everything it can to prevent terrorist attacks on Israel during negotiations.  Extremists should not be allowed to destroy negotiations. * Finally, the U.S. should not give unconditional support to either party, and should be willing to withhold support (financial and otherwise) from either party if recalcitrant.",

The unions argue that the 40-day or 60-day campaign before a union election is skewed in favor of an employer, as union organizers are barred from company property.The employer, meanwhile, has 24/7 access to employees and can hold group or one-on-one meetings or take other steps to turn the workforce against unionization.

      "submission": "Trust in elected public officials around the globe has rapidly eroded due to lack of transparency, and across the board sweetheart deals, including for themselves, and this includes the US. And, in the US, most of the power is in the hands of Lawyers (vast majority of members of Congress and State elected officials) as well as professionals of the capital markets. In addition, four Northeastern University graduates go in and out of government protecting their own and their industry interests. Even all the Supreme Court Justices are graduates of three Northeastern Universities. These are verifiable  facts, and in my opinion, the root causes of our major problems with both the trust and economic issues. If you agree, what practical steps do you suggest we need to take to remedy this situation, and how do you plan to help make it happen ?  Practical, doable changes, not just platitudes please. Thank you and I would appreciate receiving your thoughts to my email address.  ",
